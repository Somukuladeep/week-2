<h3>DHTML</h3>
<p>DHTML stands for Dynamic Hyper Text Markup Language,<br>it is totally different from HTML. The browsers which support the dynamic html are someof the versions of Netscape Navigator<br>and Internet Explorer of version higherthan 4.0.<br>
The DHTML is based on the properties of the HTML, Javascript,CSS and DOM(Document Object Model which is used to access individual elements of a document><br>which helps in making dynamic content. It is the combination of HTML,CSS,JS, and DOM<br>
The DHTML make use of Dynamic object model to makechanges in setting and also in properties and methods.<br>It also makes use of Scripting and it is also part of earlier computing trends. DHTML allows different scripting languages in a web page<br>
to change their variables, whichenhances the effects, looks and many others functions <br> after the whole page have been fully loaded or under a view proces, or otherwise static HTML pages on the same. But in true ways, there is nothing that as <br>
dynamic in DHTML, there is only the enclosing of different technologies like CSS, HTML, JS, DOM, and  different sets of static languages<br>which makes it as Dynamic.
